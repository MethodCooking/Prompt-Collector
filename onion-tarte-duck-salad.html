IMPORTANT: For all ingredients, use the format "Ingredient name, quantity" - NEVER reverse this order. Use hyphens (-) for all bullet points.

===== INTRODUCTION =====

Alright! Trey here (as you probably already know). Nice job - you've taken the leap from watching to doing, and that's what cooking is all about! I'm glad you're bringing me along for the journey.

We're here to make:

- STUNNING RED ONION TARTE TATIN with goat's cheese, watercress and hazelnuts 
- BEAUTIFUL BITTER LEAF SALAD with seared duck breast and apple

Doesn't that sound great? I'm ready to get started whenever you are.

I've structured this as a clear timeline so you can stay organized and actually make this happen. This plan is designed for a 6:30 PM dinner, but just let me know if you need to adjust that timeframe - we can easily shift everything to fit your schedule.

Before we start, take a quick look through the ingredients. Don't have something? No worries - let me know and I can suggest substitutes or adjustments. This is your kitchen, your meal - I'm just here to guide you through it with some techniques I've found helpful.

DUCK SALAD & ONION TARTE TATIN – COOKING PLAN
Target Meal Time: 6:30 PM (Let me know if you need to adjust this!)

===== SECTION 1: 4:15 PM – START PREP & PREHEAT OVEN =====

MAIN STEPS:
1. Put on apron - Chef
2. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F) fan
3. Gather all ingredients and tools
4. Place duck breasts in freezer (10-15 minutes)
   - Duck breasts, 2

I always set a quick 5-minute timer when I start prep - it's not a hard deadline, but it gets my head in the game and creates a good flow. Having a deadline, even a soft one, really helps me focus.

PREP STATION:
For my prep station I organize everything around my cutting board.
- Waste bin (I love a square bowl that fits flush against the counter)
- Small bowls for prepped ingredients 
- Bench scraper 

Having this setup means you never break your flow to search for things or clean up.

BATCHING PREP TASKS:
I like to batch my prep tasks, things that use similar tool or similar actions together.
- All scale measurements together 
- All knife work together
- Measuring dry ingredients together 
- Measuring wet ingredients together 

It creates a rhythm in your workflow and keeps things efficient.

MISE EN PLACE PREP:

A. ONIONS:
- Peel and cut into 2 cm wedges (leave root intact)
  - Red onions, 3 large

When cutting those onions, I peel them from pole to pole - a technique my mom taught me for peeling oranges. Just score the skin around the equator with a paring knife and it pulls off cleanly. And make sure not to cut all the way through the root end - keeping it intact helps the wedges hold together when they cook.

B. HERBS:
- Pick thyme leaves
  - Thyme, 4 sprigs
- Chop herbs
  - Chives, 1 tablespoon, chopped

C. BREAD:
- Tear into chunky croutons
  - White bread (stale), 175 g

D. MEASURE KEY INGREDIENTS:
- Butter for caramel
  - Unsalted butter, 25g, diced
- Nuts
  - Walnuts, 120g
  - Hazelnuts, 40g

E. SALAD GREENS:
- Wash and dry
  - Frisée lettuce, ½ head
  - Red endive, 1 head
  - Watercress, 20g (set aside for garnish)

Ready for the next step?

===== SECTION 2: 4:30 PM – PREPARE DUCK BREASTS =====

MAIN STEPS:
1. Remove duck breasts from freezer and score the skin
   - Duck breasts, from earlier
2. Season generously with salt and pepper
   - Sea salt, to taste
   - Cracked black pepper, to taste
3. Let duck sit at room temperature while you continue prep
   - Duck breasts, seasoned

I do this after the other prep so there's no cross-contamination with raw meat. The brief time in the freezer firms up the skin and makes scoring so much easier - clean cuts without dragging the knife. And letting it come back to room temperature before cooking is crucial for even cooking.

===== SECTION 3: 4:40 PM – MAKE BALSAMIC CARAMEL =====

IMPORTANT PREP NOTE:
Make sure to have your balsamic vinegar and butter measured and ready - when caramel hits the right temperature, you need to move quickly.

MAIN STEPS:
1. In a 20 cm ovenproof pan over medium heat, melt sugar evenly
   - Caster sugar, 60g

Here's a trick I came up with that I'm pretty proud of: I put the sugar in a funnel, block the bottom with my finger, then hold a spoon with the curved side facing the opening. When I release my finger, the sugar spreads evenly across the spoon, letting me distribute it perfectly across the pan. Makes a huge difference in how evenly it caramelizes.

As it heats, you'll see hot spots where the sugar melts faster - just sweep the excess sugar over those spots to keep everything cooking evenly.

2. When golden amber (170°C/340°F max), remove from heat and add vinegar (it will bubble)
   - Balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon
3. Stir in diced butter until glossy
   - Unsalted butter, 25g, diced

Ready for the next step?

===== SECTION 4: 4:55 PM – ASSEMBLE AND BAKE TARTE TATIN =====

IMPORTANT TIP:
When adding the onions, make sure the root ends face UP so the onions hold together and splay out nicely when you flip the tart.

MAIN STEPS:
1. Pack onion wedges snugly into caramel, root-side UP
   - Red onion wedges, from earlier
2. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves
   - Sea salt, to taste
   - Cracked black pepper, to taste
   - Thyme leaves, from earlier
3. Cut puff pastry into a circle slightly larger than pan, place over onions, tuck edges
   - Puff pastry sheet, 100g

When I need to cut perfect circles, I use the parchment paper the dough comes in - reminds me of my fashion design days at Halpern in London. Cutting between two pieces of paper gives you such clean edges.

4. Cut a small steam hole in center and bake for 55 minutes (check every 15 mins)
   - Oven temperature, 200°C/400°F fan

And into the oven it goes! We'll see who knows how it turns out - that's the beauty of cooking. You follow the steps and sometimes it's a pleasant surprise.

===== SECTION 5: 5:05 PM – SEAR DUCK BREASTS =====

MAIN STEPS:
1. Heat ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat
2. Place duck breasts skin-side down, cook undisturbed for 5–6 minutes until golden and fat renders
   - Duck breasts, from earlier
3. Flip duck, transfer to oven for 8 minutes (same temp: 200°C/400°F)
4. Remove duck, wrap loosely in foil and set aside to rest. Save the pan with fat and juices
   - Duck breasts, 2 (cooked and resting)
   - Duck resting juices, reserve
   - Duck fat in pan, reserve

Oh! I just remembered - if you notice you forgot to poke holes in your tart like I did, don't stress. Just pull it out halfway through, poke a few holes, and put it back in. Cooking isn't about perfection, it's about adapting when things don't go exactly to plan.

===== SECTION 6: 5:20 PM – REDUCE VERMOUTH FOR VINAIGRETTE =====

MAIN STEPS:
1. Return duck pan to stove, pour off excess duck fat (save some for croutons)
   - Duck fat, reserved (pour off excess)
2. Add vermouth and simmer until reduced by half
   - Red vermouth, 100ml

Ready for the next step?

===== SECTION 7: 5:25 PM – CRISP THE BREAD & CARAMELIZE WALNUTS =====

BREAD STEPS:
1. In saved duck fat (or olive oil), fry bread until golden and crisp, then drain on paper towel
   - Torn white bread, from earlier
   - Duck fat or olive oil, as needed
   - Sea salt, to taste

WALNUT STEPS:
1. In a clean dry pan, toast walnuts for 2 minutes
   - Walnuts, 120g
2. Add sugar and water, stir to caramelize (2–3 mins), spread to cool
   - Caster sugar, 60g
   - Water, 1 tablespoon

Ready for the next step?

===== SECTION 8: 5:40 PM – MAKE BEE POLLEN VINAIGRETTE =====

MAIN STEPS:
1. Collect duck resting juices and combine in a bowl with:
   - Duck resting juices, from earlier
   - Reduced vermouth, from earlier
   - Apple vinegar, 2 tablespoons
   - Honey, 1 generous teaspoon
   - Bee pollen granules, 1 teaspoon
   - Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon (I like to add this even though it's not in the original recipe - it really boosts the flavor)
2. Slowly whisk in olive oil until emulsified
   - Extra virgin olive oil, 3–4 tablespoons
3. Season to taste
   - Sea salt, to taste
   - Cracked black pepper, to taste

Trust your instincts with seasonings here - taste as you go and adjust. Life is about tasting, you know? Don't want to die stupid, as I like to say.

===== SECTION 9: 5:50 PM – REST TARTE TATIN & GLAZE HAZELNUTS =====

TARTE RESTING:
1. Remove tarte from oven and rest on rack for 20 minutes (invert at 6:10 PM)
   - Tarte tatin, baked

HAZELNUT STEPS:
1. Melt butter in a pan and add hazelnuts
   - Unsalted butter, 15g
   - Hazelnuts, 40g
2. Stir until golden and glossy, then season lightly and cool
   - Sea salt, to taste

Ready for the next step?

===== SECTION 10: 6:10 PM – ASSEMBLE DUCK SALAD =====

APPLE PREP:
1. Thinly slice apples (slice fresh to avoid browning)
   - Apples, 2

I always leave apple prep to the last minute to prevent browning - one of those little tricks that makes a big difference in the final presentation.

SALAD ASSEMBLY:
1. In large bowl, gently toss:
   - Frisée lettuce, ½ head
   - Red endive, 1 head
   - Sliced apples, 2
   - Caramelized walnuts, from earlier
   - Crisped bread, from earlier
2. Unwrap rested duck and slice thinly; add to salad
   - Duck breasts, sliced
3. Drizzle with vinaigrette and toss gently
   - Bee pollen vinaigrette, from earlier
4. Garnish with chopped chives
   - Chives, 1 tablespoon

Feel free to sneak a taste of the components as you assemble. It's one of the perks of being the cook!

MAIN STEPS:
1. Return tarte pan briefly to low heat to loosen caramel
